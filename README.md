### Inspired By:
[Git Explorer](https://gitexplorer.com/) - I thought the utility was pretty cool, but wanted to attempt to do the same, see how quickly I could build a prototype, and make it a lot more flexible.

Here are some things I'd like for this project to have:
- [x] write it in React and TypeScript and styled with Tailwind
- [x] a cleaner data model (one JSON file instead of 3)
- [x] having a more flexibile data set with infinite dropdowns (Git Explorer only allows for 3 maximum)
- [ ] write many more `explora` data sets beyond just `git`
- [ ] write a JSON Schema for people to use against and build their own `explora` data sets
- [ ] allow users to come in and point to any `explora` data set across the web and have their data set read
